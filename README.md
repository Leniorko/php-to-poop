Chrome extension that replaces every PHP mention on a page with a poop emoji.

It works only one way. I tried to make a toggler between states, but the Chrome extension API is too poorly documented, so I don't want to finish this stuff.

It also doesn't work properly when you are navigating through a web page and the content changes. I don't want to fix this and turning a little joke into something big.
